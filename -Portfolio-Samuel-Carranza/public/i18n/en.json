     "I am Samuel Carranza, a Bachelor in Social Communication, passionate about <strong>audiovisual production</strong>, <strong>photography</strong> and <strong>multimedia editing</strong>. My main focus is <strong>video editing</strong>,  and I work with tools such as Adobe Suite (Premiere, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.), Davinci Resolve, Capcut, Canva, and Reaper. My approach to communications has been to translate concepts into audiovisual language that creates an impact and redefines messages that often go unnoticed. I aim to capture the viewer's attention to details and a broader image, enabling them to connect with complex narratives.",
    "I have a strong focus on <strong>storytelling</strong>, where well-thought-out and <strong>visually appealing video</strong> or <strong>photography editing</strong> transforms the viewer into an active element of visual narratives. I am also a Copywriter with SEO knowledge, specializing in content optimization for better positioning.", "Do you have something in mind where I can help you? Contact me!"
